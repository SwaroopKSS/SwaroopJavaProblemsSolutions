        Ask for help from a TA and get it resolved.
        Get help from TA.
        Problem Description
        Given an integer array A of size N. You are asked to perfom Q queries on the given array and return the final array after processing all queries.

        Each query is of type ( l, r, c), for each query add c in index range l to r.

        NOTE: Value of each element in the final array will fit in 32 bit signed integer.



        Problem Constraints
        1 <= N, Q <= 105

        -106 <= A[i], c <= 106

        1 <= l <= r <= N



        Input Format
        First argument is an integer array A of size N.

        Second argument is a 2d array B of size Q x 3, where B[i][0] = l, B[i][1] = r and B[i][2] = c.



        Output Format
        Return the final array after processing all queries.
