Problem Description
        Write a program to find the node at which the intersection of two singly linked lists, A and B, begins. For example, the following two linked lists:

        A:          a1 → a2
        ↘
        c1 → c2 → c3
        ↗
        B:     b1 → b2 → b3
        NOTE:

        If the two linked lists have no intersection at all, return null.
        The linked lists must retain their original structure after the function returns.
        You may assume there are no cycles anywhere in the entire linked structure.
        Your code should preferably run in O(n) time and use only O(1) memory.
        The custom input to be given is different than the one explained in the examples. Please be careful.


        Problem Constraints
        0 <= |A|, |B| <= 106



        Input Format
        The first argument of input contains a pointer to the head of the linked list A.

        The second argument of input contains a pointer to the head of the linked list B.



        Output Format
        Return a pointer to the node after which the linked list is intersecting.



        Example Input
        Input 1:

        A = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
        B = [6, 3, 4, 5]
        Input 2:

        A = [1, 2, 3]
        B = [4, 5]


        Example Output
        Output 1:

        [3, 4, 5]
        Output 2:

        []

Certainly, I'll explain the logic in detail:

        The approach used to find the intersection of two linked lists while optimizing for both time complexity and space complexity involves iterating through the lists in such a way that they meet at the intersection point, if one exists.

        Calculate the Lengths of Both Linked Lists:
        The first step is to calculate the lengths of both linked lists, A and B. This can be done by traversing each linked list while counting the number of nodes. This step is necessary to determine the relative positions of the two lists.

        Adjust the Starting Point of Longer Linked List:
        The longer linked list needs to be adjusted so that both linked lists have an equal number of nodes to traverse before reaching the potential intersection point. This is because, if there is an intersection, it must occur after an equal number of nodes from both lists.

        Traverse Both Linked Lists Equally:
        Start traversing both linked lists simultaneously, moving one step at a time. Compare the current nodes of the two linked lists. If the nodes are equal, it means the intersection point has been found. Return the current node at this point.

        No Intersection Found:
        If you reach the end of both linked lists without finding an intersection point, it means there is no intersection between the lists. In this case, return null.

        In summary, this approach takes advantage of the fact that by making both linked lists traverse the same number of nodes before reaching the potential intersection point, they will eventually meet at the intersection if it exists. This approach ensures an O(n) time complexity, where n is the length of the longer linked list, and O(1) space complexity as it only uses a constant amount of additional memory for the pointers.

        The code provided in the previous response implements this logic in Java. It calculates the lengths of both linked lists, adjusts their starting points, and then iterates through the lists to find the intersection node or determine that no intersection exists. The getLength function calculates the length of a linked list, and the getIntersectionNode function implements the main logic to find the intersection point. The provided main function demonstrates how to use the solution with the given examples.
